# NottAnotherMasterSetTrackerBackend
This repo is not really for collaboration but a place to keep myself honest and working on a project regularly by making my contributions public.
However, if you have any issues with the website, please feel free to open up a ticket and/or even a pull request. I will put down information on how to set up for local development when I get to it.
